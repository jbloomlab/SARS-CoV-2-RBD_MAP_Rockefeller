# Logo plots with overlays
This directory contains the notebook [logo_overlays.ipynb](logo_overlays.ipynb) that builds logo plots with heatmap overlays.

The notebook is not part of the master `Snakemake` pipeline because there will generally be lots of highly customized input / output files.

All the configuration is specified in [logo_overlays_config.yaml](logo_overlays_config.yaml).

The results are placed in [./results/](results).
