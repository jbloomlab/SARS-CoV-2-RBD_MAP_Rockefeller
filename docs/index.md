# Interactive structural visualizations of mutational escape from three structural classes of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies and polyclonal plasma

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on binding by monoclonal antibodies of three structural classes and polyclonal convalescent human sera. These results reveal that mutational escape from the polyclonal antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely shaped by a single class of antibodies.

These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/). These experiments are described in this preprint (**add link**), and raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_Rockefeller/blob/main/results/supp_data/NY_mabs_sera_raw_data.csv).

Sites where mutations reduce binding are shown for each monoclonal antibody or polyclonal plasma, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound RBD structure ([PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J)).

`dms-view` renderings for each antibody’s escape mapped to its respective antibody-bound spike trimer or isolated RBD structure (structures published in [Barnes, et al.

(2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2381-y)). Some antibodies have more than one published structure:
 - Class 1 antibodies (antibodies bound to "up" RBD):
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C105 (6XCM)</a> (2 RBDs "up")
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C105 (6XCN)</a> (3 RBDs "up")
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">LY-CoV016 (7C01)</a>* (isolated RBD:Fab)
 - Class 2 antibodies (antibodies primarily bound to "down" RBDs):
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C144 (7K90)</a> (3 RBDs "down")
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C002 (7K8S)</a> (3 RBDs "down")
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C002 (7K8T)</a> (2 RBDs "down")

     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C121 (7K8Y)</a> (1 RBD "down")
 - Class 3 antibodies (antibodies bound to "down" RBDs):
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C135 (7K8Z)</a> (2 RBDs "down")
     - <a href="link_goes_here" target="_blank">C110 (7K8V)</a> (2 RBDs "down")
